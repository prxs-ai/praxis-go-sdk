      "text": "5. Thanks for your question!\n\n1. The Main Risks of Dual Investment\nThe primary risk of Dual Investment is opportunity cost, driven by market volatility. If the asset's price moves dramatically beyond your target, you can miss out on significant profits. For example, with a \"Sell High\" product, you might be forced to sell your BTC at $70,000, only to watch it rally to $85,000. Conversely, a \"Buy Low\" contract could make you buy an asset for $65,000 when its market price has crashed to $58,000. This risk is amplified because your funds are locked until the settlement date, preventing you from reacting to sudden market changes and locking in an unfavorable conversion.\n\n2. Effects of a Long-Term Sideways Market\nIn a prolonged sideways market, Dual Investment can be highly effective. If your target price is never met, your contracts won't execute. Instead, you'll repeatedly receive your initial asset back plus a high-interest APR, allowing you to steadily accumulate more of your chosen crypto or stablecoin. However, the hidden risk is complacency. Sideways markets often end with a sharp breakout. A sudden price surge could trigger your final \"Sell High\" contract right before a major rally, causing you to miss the upside you were waiting for. In this environment, contract execution opportunities are low, making the product feel like a pure yield tool, which can mask the underlying risk of a sudden trend change.\n\n3. Who Is Dual Investment For?\nDual Investment is best suited for investors with a patient strategy and clear price targets. This includes long-term HODLers looking to earn extra yield on their assets while setting a desirable \"sell high\" price, as well as patient buyers wanting to earn interest on their stablecoins while waiting for a specific \"buy low\" entry point. \n\nCrucially, the ideal user understands and accepts the risk of opportunity cost. They are comfortable forgoing potentially larger gains from a sudden market rally in exchange for a guaranteed, high-yield return on their own terms.\n\n*As always, the above is food for thought and shouldn't be treated as financial advice. Remember to do your own research and ensure Dual Investment products are suitable for you.",

By receiving earlier this year full approval for the takeover of Sim;paul – a licensed broker-dealer authorized by the Central Bank of Brazil, Binance is now in a privileged position and gives it greater leverage to make adjustments that may become necessary as a result of the regulatory process for the cryptocurrency market and virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which is at an advanced stage in the country. \n\nThus, it mitigates risks such as halting operations or having to start the rigorous and costly licensing process from scratch.\n\nBinance was already operating in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the country as a global exchange, and with the approval became the first crypto exchange to have a broker-dealer license in Brazil.",
